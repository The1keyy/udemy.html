<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Keyshawn, a Software Engineer who loves working with cloud technology. When I was growing up, I thought technology was the coolest thing, and I spent a lot of time exploring it. As I got older, I realized I also enjoy solving problems. That is what made me decide to become a software engineer.

  What inspired me the most is learning that less than five percent of software engineers are Black. This motivated me to make an impact and be a role model for others who want to work in tech but do not always see themselves represented.

  Right now, I am working on earning my Network+ certification and getting my master’s degree. I am also restarting the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) chapter at my school, where I am the president. My goal is to help students find their path in tech and build a supportive community.

  In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, traveling, and trying out new trends in fashion. I like exploring new things because it keeps life exciting.
